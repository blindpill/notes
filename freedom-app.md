The Freedom App is THE solution for phone addiction. My average screen time nowadays is below half an hour (it used to be around 8 hours). These are the steps you have to follow:

(this guide is for iPhone only. I'm unaware of how Android works)

-Buy a lifetime subscription for Freedom. It's expensive but it's worth it. In this way you make sure that it'll never stop working if you have a problem
with your credit card or if you intentionally decide to cancel the subscription.

-Create a recurrent session for each day of the week that goes from 1pm to 1pm for example.

-On the Settings App Open >Screen Time >Content & Privacy Restrictions > iTunes & App Store Purchases > Deleting Apps > Set this to "Don't Allow". This is 
how we're going to make sure that you don't cheat and decide to delete the Freedom App.

-But the important part now is to ask for a relative or friend to change your Screen Time Passcode. If you do this then the only way of deleting Freedom is
to ask them to reveal something that you asked them not to when you were in your sound mind. Moments of temptation are going to appear but with an
external help they won't be a problem. ((You won't give in))

Of course there are ways to factory reset your phone. But the way I make sure I won't try to do this is that I currently have 60,745 photos/videos on my
iPhone 7 Plus. These files are very precious and I would definitively think twice before deleting them.

And just like that: Freedom. 

Yesterday I saw the news that the iPod is discontinnued... Well, following these steps you can turn your iPhone into an iPod and live
that sweet offline life.
